# These services can be exploited & the below commands can be used to establish the connection directly without using Metasploit.

### 1. `FTP, NetBIOS-ssn, SSH older version vulnerability`
- Find the ftp service version.
- Search for the exploit in Metasploit.
- exploit using the payload & build the connection.

### 2. Unsecure running `bindshell/reverseshell service`:
- Use to make a connection to other machines in a network.
- It uses UDP/TCP protocols to connect over a port to the bindshell/reverseshell.
- Can make direct connections as `eg. nc or netcat <target_IP> <target-Port>`

### 3. Open `telnet Service` vulnerability:
- Can make the direct connection as `telnet <TargetVM-IP>`

### 4. Bruteforcing:
- The SSH login requires Username & Password, which can be obtained from Bruteforcing.
- `Search for the ssh` payload in Metasploit > Set the options > exploit with custom list of Username & password.
- Once exploited & got the Username & password, use `ssh <TargetUsername>@<TargetIP>`

### 5. Distccd:
- distccd stands for "Distributed C Compiler Daemon." It is a service that allows multiple machines on a network to share the work of compiling code, specifically C and C++ code.
- If it's vuln then it allows `Reverse Shell` session over Telnet.
