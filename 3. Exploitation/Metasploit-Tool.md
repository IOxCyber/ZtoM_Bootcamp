## [Metasploit Framework](https://www.metasploit.com/)
- [Github](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework)
- [Documentation](https://docs.metasploit.com/)
- `Metasploitable` the vulnerable VM to be worked as Target.
- Path: `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/`
- Modules: `7 Different components` which contain `Exploit` code `eg. `
- A Typical welcoming screen:

## Payloads: `3 different types of payload modules in the Metasploit Framework: Singles, Stagers, and Stages`
- - `Singles − Small and designed to create some kind of communication`, then move to the next stage.
- - `Staged − To upload a bigger file onto a victim system.`
- - `Stages − Ppayload components that are downloaded by Stagers modules.`
 
## General Process:
- Scan the Metasploitable `eg. nmap -sV <Metasploitable_VM_IP>`
- Find the service version running on this VM.
- Search the version for vulnerability: `searchsploit <Service-Name>`
- Go to Metasploit >>
- - Search the same for any payload available: `search <Service-Name>`
- - Copy the path & `use` the payload
- - & `exploit` now the target must be exploited & can have the target's Terminal.

## Usage:
- To search for an exploit: `eg. search <exploit_name>`
- To select the exploit: `use <exploit_path or number>`
- To check the options/modules/exploit/target: `eg. show options`
- To set the payloads/target Hosts: `eg set RHOST 192.168.X.X`
- `back` to go to the previous directory
- `searchsploit` to get the vulnerability info associated with the service version `eg: searchsploit `
