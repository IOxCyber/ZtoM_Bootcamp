### Exploit/Payload/shell:
- A piece of code that can take advantage of a bug or vulnerability in the system & exploit them.
- A sequence of commands or program called as payload.
- These payload needs to deliver to target machine as a masked/legit file like doc,pdf,images etc.

### Reverse Shell: (Attacker VM = Listener & Remote VM = Initiator)
- Reverse Shell/Connect Back-shell/ Remote shell (a shell session created after exploitation of Remote machine on the hacker's machine) [Attacker's VM will open it's ports & listen to connect with Remote VM]
- Reverse shell attacks involve the victim's system connecting back to the attacker's system.

### Bind Shell: (Remote VM = Listener & Hacker VM = Initiator)
- Bind shell attacks involve the attacker's system connecting to the victim's system.
- Remote machine listen on the Open port & connect with hacher's VM.
> Issue: A firewall can restrict/close the ports of Remote VM if a hacker tries to open the port.
