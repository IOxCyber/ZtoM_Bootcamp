### Exploit/Payload/shell:
- A piece of code that can take advantage of a bug or vulnerability in the system & exploit them.
- A sequence of commands or programs called a payload.
- These payload needs to deliver to the target machine as a masked/legit file like doc, pdf, images, etc.

### Reverse Shell: `Attacker VM = Listener & Target VM = Initiator` (Mostly Used)
- Reverse Shell/Connect Back-shell/ Remote shell (a shell session created after exploitation of the Remote machine on the hacker's machine)
- `Attacker's VM will open its ports & listen to connect with Remote VM`
- Reverse shell attacks involve the victim's system connecting back to the attacker's system.

### Bind Shell: `Target VM = Listener & Attacker VM = Initiator`
- Bind shell attacks involve the attacker's system connecting to the victim's system.
- Target machine listens on the Open port & connects with the hacker's VM.
> Issue: A firewall can restrict/close the ports of the Remote VM if a hacker tries to open the port.


## [Metasploit Framework](https://github.com/cybersome/CyberEssentials/tree/main/Metasploit)
- `Metasploitable` the vulnerable VM to be worked as Target.
- Path: `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/`
- Modules: `Different components` which contain `Exploit` code.
- Payloads: ``
- `set` to set the `payloads/targets`
- `show` to check the `options/modules/exploit/target` etc
- `back` to go to previous directory
- `searchsploit` to get the vulnerability info associated with the service version.
