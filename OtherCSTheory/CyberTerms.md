## Payloads:
- a piece of code that executes when hackers exploit a vulnerability on the target machine or trick user to execute it (masked as pdf, image etc in email attachment).
- a malware that the threat actor uses to deliver to the victim after exploitation.
- used to describe what a virus, worm or Trojan is designed to do on a victim's computer.
- can be generated payloads with a GUI, eg. with the Metasploit framework.
- For example, if a cybercriminal sent out an email with a malicious Macro as the attachment and the victim gets infected with ransomware, then the ransomware is the payload (and not the email or document).

## Reverse Shell vs Bind Shell Payloads: Shell is the Terminal of Operating System.
> How 2 systems connects over a network, One listener (waits) & another is Sender

1. Reverse Shell: (Host[^1] listens on its open ports to connect with Target)
- Host listens on open port.
- 

2. Bind Shell: (Target[^2] listens on its open ports to connect with Host)
- Target listens on open port.
- Firewall can forbid to open port on machine.




















[^1]: 'host' is the machine (or architecture, or platform) that you are using to compile the code.
[^2]:'target' is the machine (or architecture, or platform) that is intended to run the code.
