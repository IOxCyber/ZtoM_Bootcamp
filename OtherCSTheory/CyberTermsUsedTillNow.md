## Payloads:
- a piece of code that executes when hackers exploit a vulnerability on the target machine or trick user to execute it (masked as pdf, image etc in email attachment).
- a malware that the threat actor uses to deliver to the victim after exploitation.
- used to describe what a virus, worm or Trojan is designed to do on a victim's computer.
- can be generated payloads with a GUI, eg. with the Metasploit framework.
- For example, if a cybercriminal sent out an email with a malicious Macro as the attachment and the victim gets infected with ransomware, then the ransomware is the payload (and not the email or document).

2. Bind Shell: ( Target[^1] opens its ports)
- 




















[^1]: 'host' is the machine (or architecture, or platform) that you are using to compile the code; 'target' is the machine (or architecture, or platform) that is intended to run the code.
