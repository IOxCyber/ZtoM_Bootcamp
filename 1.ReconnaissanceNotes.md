# Information-Gathering stage of ethical hacking.

## Two Types of Recon
  1. Active - By Interacting with target eg. social engineering, active scanning etc 
  2. Passive - Indirectly (Middle source) eg. thu a websites eg. ipchecker, whatweb 

###

## How to get IP address of Target:
ping - To send ICMP packets to the website.
eg. ping xx.xx.xx.xx

### nslookup 
To get IP of Target by Hostname.
eg. nslookup hostname

###
whois: More info about target.
eg. DNS servers, physical location, Registration Data etc 

### WhatWeb: 
Stealthy level(Http only), web scanner to to identify different web technologies used by the website.
Whatweb offers both passive scanning and aggressive testing.

eg. whatweb website -v (verbose for better readability)

## Scan a VM(Home Network) by [whatweb](https://www.whatweb.net/) tool:
1. get the IP (ifconfig)
2. scan the complete range of IP.
3. whatweb ip-range --aggression <aggression_level> -v --no-error (to not show error which comes by scanning the offline IPs)
aggression_level: 1- Stealthy, 3- Aggressive, 4- Heavy

***To Save the result, use > (greater than sign):***
> whatweb ip-range --aggression <aggression_level> -v --no-error > result.txt

### [Harvester - Kali Tool](https://www.kali.org/tools/theharvester/)
: To find email accounts, subdomain names, virtual hosts, open ports / banners, and employee names related to a specific domain or all domains.

> syntex: theHarvester -d <Target_Domain> -l <Int_Result_Limit> -b <Specific_source> or all

- By default gives 500 results.
- Not always provides required results.

### [Hunter.io - The Website](https://hunter.io/?via=ion)
Paid or free account.
Only 5 mails without sign in

### Other Information Gathering tools can be found on GitHub.
## How to Download tools from GitHub: git clone "GitHub_link_of_tool"
eg. RedHawk, Sherlock, [Other Tools](https://securitytrails.com/blog/osint-tools)

## How to enable Copy/Paste in VM: Devices > Drag and Drop > set Bidirectional.
