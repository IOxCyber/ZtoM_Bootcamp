## Basics:
- Provides interactive shell of the Target machine.
- supports the linux/windows commands `eg. ls, dir, pwd, rm, mkdir etc`.
- supports file system commands `eg. cat, cd, dir, ls etc`
- supports Networking cmd `eg. `

## Use Case:
- Download a file from Target VM: `download <file-name>`
- Upload a file from Local VM: `upload <file-name>`
- Edit a file: `edit <file-name>`
- To check arp table: `arp`

## Privilege Escalation:
- Using scripts `eg. Local Exploit Modules`[^1], available in Metasploit frameworks.
- Local Exploit Modules require a `session ID` to run.
- some examples: `bypass 2017`






 
[^1]:Local exploit module:
- `targets vulnerabilities in a locally installed program` or system on the target machine. Unlike remote exploits that target vulnerabilities over a network.
- can help an attacker gain higher privileges or execute code with the permissions of an existing user or system service.
- Local exploits are limited to the vulnerabilities on the target system and do not rely on network-based attacks.
