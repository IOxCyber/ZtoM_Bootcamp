## Privilege Escalation using Meterpreter:
- Privilege can be escalated using scripts `eg. Local Exploit Modules`[^1], available in Metasploit frameworks.
- Local Exploit Modules require a `session ID` to run, also the `Port` must be different from the session exploit.
- some examples: `bypassuac`[^2] 2017 & after getting the meterpreter shell, `run getsystem` to elevate the privilege.

## Transfer the Shell via Kali-Apache-Server:

## Persistence Existance:
- Prerequisite: `An Admin Account on Windows System` to run persistence service, `Persistence_service` exploit module,  



 
[^1]: Local exploit module: 
Targets vulnerabilities in a locally installed program or system on the target machine. Unlike remote exploits that target vulnerabilities over a network.
Can help an attacker gain higher privileges or execute code with the permissions of an existing user or system service.
Local exploits are limited to the vulnerabilities on the target system and do not rely on network-based attacks.

[^2]: User Account Control, use to elevate the privilege on target system.
