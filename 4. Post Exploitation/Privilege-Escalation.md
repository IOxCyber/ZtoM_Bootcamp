## Privilege Escalation using Meterpreter:
- Privilege can be escalated using scripts `eg. Local Exploit Modules`[^1], available in Metasploit frameworks.
- Local Exploit Modules require a `session ID` to run, also the `Port` must be different from the session exploit.
- some examples: `bypassuac[^2] 2017`






 
[^1]:Local exploit module:
- `targets vulnerabilities in a locally installed program` or system on the target machine. Unlike remote exploits that target vulnerabilities over a network.
- can help an attacker gain higher privileges or execute code with the permissions of an existing user or system service.
- Local exploits are limited to the vulnerabilities on the target system and do not rely on network-based attacks.

[^2]: User Account Control, use to elevate the privilege on target system.
