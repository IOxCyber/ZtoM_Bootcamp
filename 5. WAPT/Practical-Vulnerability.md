## 1. Command Execution:
- A vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands in the Input field on a site.

### Real Life Example:
- Imagine a website that allows users to search for files by entering a filename. If the `website doesn't properly sanitize user input`, an attacker could input malicious commands instead of filenames. 
- For instance, if the attacker inputs "; ls -la", it could execute the "ls -la" command on the server, listing all files in the directory.

### How to Avoid it:
```
To avoid command execution vulnerabilities, developers should implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques.
Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to interact with databases, preventing SQL injection attacks.
Avoid executing system commands based on user input. If unavoidable, use safe APIs or libraries that automatically handle input sanitization.
Apply principle of least privilege, ensuring that application processes have only the necessary permissions to execute specific commands.
Regularly update and patch software to fix known vulnerabilities that could be exploited for command execution.
```
