# Cyber Kill Chain Overview:

## 1. Reconnaissance:
- What: Gathering information about the target.
- Why: Identify potential vulnerabilities and targets.
- Where to Use: Open-source intelligence, social media, public records.

## 2. Weaponization:
- What: Developing and creating malicious tools or payloads.
- Why: Prepare the attack with weaponized tools.
- Where to Use: Malware creation, exploit development.

## 3. Delivery:
- What: Sending the weaponized payload to the target system.
- Why: Get the malicious payload to the target environment.
- Where to Use: Email attachments, infected websites, USB drives.

## 4. Exploitation:
- What: Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access.
- Why: Use vulnerabilities to enter the target system.
- Where to Use: Vulnerability exploits, system weaknesses.

## 5. Installation:
- What: Installing malware on the compromised system.
- Why: Establish persistence and control over the system.
- Where to Use: Droppers, backdoors, rootkits.

## 6. Command and Control (C2):
- What: Establishing communication channels for control.
- Why: Maintain remote control over the compromised system.
- Where to Use: Remote servers, covert channels.

## 7. Actions on Objectives:
- What: Achieving the primary goal of the attack (e.g., data theft, disruption).
- Why: Fulfill the attacker's ultimate objectives.
- Where to Use: Data exfiltration, manipulation, destruction.
